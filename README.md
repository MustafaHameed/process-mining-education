# Educational Process Mining Analysis

This project implements educational process mining analysis on the EPM (Educational Process Mining) dataset from the University of Genoa. The analysis provides insights into student learning behaviors, process patterns, and educational performance.

## Dataset
The EPM dataset contains behavioral data from 115 first-year engineering students during 6 laboratory sessions of a digital electronics course. Students used the DEEDS (Digital Electronics Education and Design Suite) simulation environment.

## Features
- **Data Extraction and Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the dataset for process mining
- **Process Discovery**: Discover educational process models and visualize learning paths
- **Performance Analysis**: Calculate metrics and identify patterns in student progression
- **Conformance Checking**: Compare actual vs expected learning behaviors
- **Insights Generation**: Create visualizations and actionable insights

## Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
```bash
python main.py
```

## Output
The analysis generates:
- Process models and visualizations
- Performance metrics and statistics
- Conformance checking results
- Educational insights and recommendations
